1. Pick a random word.

For example, if the word was HAPPY, the first player
would write:
_ _ _ _ _

The guessing player tries to guess the letters in the word.
Each time they guess a letter correctly, the player fills in the
blanks for each occurrence of that letter. For example, if the guessing player guessed the letter P, the  player would fill in the Ps
in the word HAPPY like so:
_ _ P P _

When the guessing player guesses a letter that isn‚Äôt in the

in the word HAPPY like so:
H _ P P _

If the player Finish his All point and Made all the Eggs Sad ! before the guessing
player guesses the word, the
guessing player loses. ‚òπÔ∏è
